Encapsulation allowed us to reuse parts of our code from one function
to another. For example we called a function to draw a circle in our
function to draw a pumpkin. Further using the pumpkin function as an 
example, the code was made more modular using encapsulation when The of
the pumpkin and the stem where in different sections in the same function,
and the code is even more modular since The eyes and mouth are seperate 
functions.

This also allows the code to be more Generalized, as we can use it to draw 
any size pumpkin, or star, or eye, or any number of them. Generalization 
allowed us to create reusable functions that can even let us make any number
of stars, pumpkins, eyes, or mouths. The faces of the pumpkins don't even 
all have to have the same scale to the pumpkin or relative position, making 
the code very generalized.
